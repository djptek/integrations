# Box Integration

This integration periodically fetches events from [Box](https://app.box.com/). It can parse events created by Box on behalf of the user or enterprise. 

## Compatibility

The Box Web Application does not feature version numbers, see this [Community Post](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000033881/comments/1500000038001). This integration was configured and tested against Box in the second quarter of 2022.

### Box Events

The Box events API enables subscribing to live events across the enterprise or for a particular user, or querying historical events across the enterprise.
